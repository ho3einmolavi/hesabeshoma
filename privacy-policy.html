                <ul>

                            user of the Service. We gather this information from you directly when you enter it, or from
                            integrations that you linked to the Service (Facebook, Instagram, etc.). When you ask us to
                            sign DPA or other documents, we also receive data about you and your representatives.</p>

                <p>You have the right to request that we delete any personal data about you that we have collected. Upon
                    receiving a verified request to delete personal data, we will do so unless otherwise required or
                    authorized by law. You may submit a request to delete personal data via this&nbsp;"<a

                <p><strong>3. Authorized Agents</strong></p>
                <p>You may designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf. You must provide an authorized
                    agent written permission to submit a request on your behalf, and we may require that you verify your
                    identity directly with us and confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to
                    submit the rights request. This verification process is not necessary if your authorized agent
                    provides documentation reflecting that the authorized agent has the power of attorney to act on your
                    behalf under Cal. Prob. Code §§ 4121 to 4130.</p>
                <p><strong>4. Methods for Submitting Consumer Requests and Our Response to Requests</strong></p>
                <p>You may submit a request for access and requests to delete personal data about you via:&nbsp;"<a
                        href="https://Jainsta.com/support">Privacy &amp; Security</a> <a
                        href="https://Jainsta.com/support/features/privacy/">section of Support Page</a>"&nbsp;or via
                    email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@Jainsta.com">privacy@Jainsta.com</a>.</p>
                <p>Upon receipt of a request, we may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. Any
                    additional information you provide will be used only to verify your identity and not for any other
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>We will acknowledge the receipt of your request within ten (10) business days of receipt. Subject to
                    our ability to verify your identity, we will respond to your request within 45 calendar days of
                    receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension
                    period in writing. In order to protect your privacy and the security of personal data about you, we
                    verify your request by email.</p>
                <p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer
                    request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a
                    request, if applicable.</p>
                <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is
                    excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we
                    will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your
                    request.</p>
                <p>We do not currently alter our practices when a Do Not Track signal is received, because at this time
                    no formal “Do Not Track” standard has been adopted. To learn about Do Not Track and for information

                <p>You have the right not to be discriminated against for the exercise of your California privacy rights
                    described above. Unless permitted by the California Consumer Privacy Act, we will not:</p>

                    <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts

                    <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different
                        level or quality of goods or services.</li>
